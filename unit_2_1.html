        Home Page (Index)
    <br>
        The home page is my welcoming page for my site. I used a class to create the heading inside h1 element to make this heading stand out as it was the welcoming page to my site. I used a h3 for the text within the heading so that I could individualise it for this page as it is the only instance of using this heading. I added parallax to the image so that the text scrolled over the image to give some interest to the page. I added a Menu bar on the top of all pages which highlighted the current page that was open.
    <br>
    <br>
        About me page
    <br>
        This page has some history about me and my journey into coding. I have used a parallax picture of myself set into the background so the text scrolls over the top of it. This page has the defined set up that I have put into my CSS folder to make the website uniform.
    <br>
    <br>
        Unit 1 page
    <br>
        This page has all the generic layouts set within CSS. I have included a list on this page which has a class set to it to make it stand out. I have included hyperlinks for referencing.
    <br>
    <br>
        All the other pages are set out in a similar fashion to keep consistency. They all answer questions set out within this course.
