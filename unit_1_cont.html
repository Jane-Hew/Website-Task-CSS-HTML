<h2>    Unit 1 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects - what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>
<p>
        On doing some research for this question I have come across some websites that makes you think of several reasons why a digital project might fail and the risks they face. One big factor for the failure of digital project is that the person doing the project has not done their research. Many start ups will fail due to what they thought of as an original idea not actually being original.  Other mistakes people make is the size of the project and the time it might take. This could lead to problems in cash flow and the technologies being used becoming old or obsolete. 
    <br>
    <br>
        Listening to Colin Maclachlan recently about the gaming industry, it was clear that technologies move so quickly, industry cannot always keep up. Colin talked about a five year turn around for some games and how the digital equipment is completely different at the beginning of the project than the end.  In that five years the project is not making any money and if it would be smaller companies this could cause it to collapse.
    <br>
    <br>
        Another reason projects might fail is poor planning: This could be from not allowing enough time,not allowing for change in technologies and not allowing enough finance.
    <br>
    <br>
        ‚Äú90 percent of digital decision-makers are having their ambitions to use data for new digital services held back due to a lack of resources, the complexity of using multiple technologies, or reliance on legacy database technology.""Decision-makers say that, on average, a business that can‚Äôt keep up with digital innovations in its industry will survive for less than five years before going out of business or being absorbed by a competitor"<b>[4]</b> <a href="https://www.couchbase.com/binaries/content/assets/website/docs/whitepapers/cio-survey-results"target="4"ref [4]></a>
        <br>
        <br>
        By doing research I have come across a blog/site that lists reasons why a project might fail, which seem to be a common factor in all the sites that I have looked at.  These are:
    <br>
        "1.	Lack of Resources
        2.	Scope Creep
        3.	Poor Project Handling
        4.	Lack of Interest From Stakeholders
        5.	Not Paying Attention To Warning Signs
        6.	Setting Unrealistic Deadlines"<b>[5]</b> <a href="https://blog.taskque.com/why-projects-fail/"target="5"ref[5]></a>

<h2>
        Unit 1 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systens and software.
</h2>
<p>
        I have been given the task to create a website. I have to describe how I would choose IT systems and software to create it. My first thought would be what is the most common and easiest IT system and software to use. In my case, I have a windows laptop and I can download Visual Studio Code for free. With Visual Studio code you can easily download other libraries to help with the task. HTML is a widely used code in which to be able to get the main body of a web-page. CSS is popular and easy to use code to create the style. I can easily find help using the internet with any issues that I might encounter with my code.
</p>
<h2>
        Unit 1 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcome.
</h2>
<p>
        I have found Trello to be a very useful tool when planning and completing a project. It helps me to keep on top of my tasks and to prioritise the ones that are needed. You can add notes and descriptions to help you with your thought process.
    <br>
    <br>
        HTML is a language with some simularities in what you are used to when using Microsoft Word processing, with Headings, line breaks etc. I found using HTML to be a bit more of a easier code to use than using CSS because with CSS it is about getting your symantics right so that your code is read properly. You can spend hours trying to get just the right colour, text etc for your project as there is so much to choose from.
</p>  
<h2>
        Unit 1 1.7 Describe legal guidance and constraints that impact digital projects
</h2>
<p>
        The UK has guidelines and laws in place for when you are creating a digital project that you need to be aware of. This can be The Digital Economy Act <b>[6]</b>, Copyright laws <b>[7]</b>, and The Data Protection Act 2018 "Under the Data Protection Act 2018, you have the right to find out what information the government and other organisations store about you." <b>[8]</b> (GDPR) which refers to Datahandling and how you manage it. <a href ="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/30/pdfs/ukpga_20170030_en.pdf"target=[6]>ref [6]></a> <a href ="https://www.gov.uk/copyright"target="[7}">ref [7]></a>
        <a href ="https://www.gov.uk/data-protection"target="[8]">ref[8]></a>
    <br>
    <br>
        These laws can impact digital projects quite a lot especially if you are creating an e-commerce site. This involves storing people's details, so, a good understanding of The Data Protection Act would be needed so that you can comply with it. If you are planning to use images on your site, you will have to be careful that you are not breaking any copyright laws. 
    <br>
    <br>
        The Digital Economy Act is a comprehensive act involving things from Internet providers, communication, to Internet courses
    <br>
    <br>
        Copyright right laws gives you and others protection for original works
        The Data Protection Act is a comprehensive act which outlines how personal data is handled and stored etc.
