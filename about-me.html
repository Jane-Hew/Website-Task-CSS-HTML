    <h2>About me</h2>
    
<p>
    My name is Jane
    <br>
    <br>
    I was born and grew up in South Bristol. I am a mother of two grown up children who are both in tech jobs. Both are proficient at programming. This is how I became interested in learning coding. They would have conversations that to me sounded almost foreign.
    <br>
    <br>
    They tried to teach me several times but they were not patient and expected me to know everything after an hour.
    <br>   
    <br>
    My job is teaching adults to use Microsoft Office software suitable for being able to get a job. I teach things such as Word, Spreadsheets, PowerPoint etc, and, to use tech for simple uses such as searching the internet, online shopping and other things that would make it useful for their everyday lives.
    <br>
    <br>
    I enjoy working with computers and expanding my knowledge of using them for different tasks.
    <br>
    <br>
    My other time is spent doing voluntary roles. I am at present a Cub leader with the Scouting organization. I have to be very organized for this role.
    <br>
    <br>
    My motivation for learning coding is that I enjoy something new that I can build upon. I do not want my mind to be stagnant.
    <br>
    <br>
    I heard about Codenation through my workplace sending an email asking if any of my students would be interested in doing the course. I have been looking at doing a course previously, so, I made contact and the rest they say is history.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am enjoying my time learning coding so far using Python, CSS and HTML and, I cannot wait to continue my learning when the course ends.
