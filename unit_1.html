        Question 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern buisness
</h2> 
   
<p>
        The main purpose of IT in modern businesses in my view is to make them more productive. Save them time and eventually money. 
    <br>
        In 2015 Business Vibes posted an article about how IT ‚Äúdrives innovation and innovation is the path to business success‚Äù. <b>[1]</b> <a href = "https://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/importance-information-technology-business-today-01393380"target="[1]">ref 1</a>
    <br>
        To me this seems that if a need is spotted then technology will innovate to fulfil that need.  This was in 2015, imagine the advances that we have made since then.
    <br>
        Many people are walking around now not understanding just what technology is doing for them. From cars to apps and even small things like smart watches, these have changed our lives. Some would say for the better, others would say that it has made us too reliant on the technologies we use today. <b>[2]</b> <a href = "https://blog.udemy.com/importance-of-information-technology/"target="[2]">ref 2</a>
    <br>
        I have my own experience of this when I worked in admin for a delivery company who used technology to store when stock was coming in, what stock needed to go out and to where, how many items of stock they had left etc. The system worked beautifully until things went wrong. Power cuts caused the system to close down and the work came to a standstill and we were sent home for the day.
    <br>
        I have also used technology to great advantage from being able to do e-learning, keeping in contact with students using technology and having meetings with colleagues using technologies.

<h2>
        Question 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete a digital project
</h2> 
<p>
        Thinking of the skills you would need to complete a digital project, you would have to think what your project involves. One skill that would come to mind was to be able to feel confident in using a computer and having access to a computer would be very important.<br>
    
        You will need to be able to plan a project out. By planning you will come to realise what tools and skills you would need. Most projects will have a time scale so you would need to be able to manage your time so that you complete on time.
<br>
        For my project of creating a website I needed quite a few skills and resources which I have listed below:
</p>
<p class="list">Skills:</p>

<ul class="list">
<li>Computer skills</li>
<li>Literacy and numeracy</li>
<li>Coding (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)</li>
<li>Being able to use the internet</li>
<li>Planning</li>
<li>Timekeeping ‚Äì being able to manage your time efficiently</li>
</ul>
<p class="list">Resources:</p>
<ul class="list">

<li>Computer</li>
<li>Appropriate software (VS, Trello, Slack, Internet explorer and Word processing)</li>
<li>Internet</li>
</ul>
<h2>
        1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT
</h2>
<p>
        To be able to achieve the best outcome possible whilst building my website I will need to create a plan.  The plan will have to be detailed.  For this I will use a Kanban system using Trello. My Trello link: <b>[3]</b>
    <a href ="https://trello.com/b/ylbTSQi9/website-task"target="[3]">ref [3]></a>
    <br>
    <br>
        I will try to keep the tasks relevant and simple. Much like programming I will need to break the tasks down into bitesize doable chunks. I will need to research certain aspects of the task using the internet. I will also need to undergo some training to have the skills needed to start building the website
