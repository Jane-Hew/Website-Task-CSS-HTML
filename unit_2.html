<h2>
        Unit 2 1.5 Describe copyright and other constraints affecting websites
</h2>
<p>
        Copyright laws are put in place to protect intellectual properties on original works such as Photos, logos, ideas, music etc When creating a website you have to be very care what photos you are using. If you are using videos with music - do you have the right to use them.
    <br>
    <br>
        Data protection Act impacts on how your site handles personal data. If you have an eCommerce business, you will need to be aware of this law. You will need to think how you are tracking customers, storing delivery addresses etc.  
</p>
<h2>
        Unit 2 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account
</h2> 
<p>
        People with disabilities face many issues when using the internet. This could be due to sight, hearing, language and other disabilities.
    <br>
    <br> 
        One simple thing that we can do is making sure we add a description for any images we might decide to put in our websites.
    <br>
    <br> 
        We need to think of the colours and Fonts that we are using. Certain colours can cause issues for people who are dyslexic for example.
    <br>
    <br> 
        Some of the big sites put things such as voice recognition into their sites for people who cannot spell or use a keyboard. They use readers for people who cannot see.
    <br>
    <br> 
        Innovation has seen things like Siri, Alexa, Bixby to name a few come forward which use software that recognises and learns speech. Machine learning allows them to even pick up in nuances from different dialects.
</p> 
<h2>
        Unit 2 1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites
</h2>
<p>
        There are many types of files that you can use for building a website. From CSS (cascading style sheet) which allows you to control how your website, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) which allows you to put the body of your site in simply.  you have files such as jpeg and png which are image files, Mp3 which is music files. These deal with mainly the Front end of your site

        You also have the back end files such as python which deals with many of the things that you might not physically see on your web=page such as database management, Mathematical problems etc.
