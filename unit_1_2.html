<h1>
    Unit 1 Outcome 2
</h1>

<h2>    Unit 1 Outcome 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used??</h2>
<p>   
        I had no design ideas when going into making my own website. No colour themes etc. I concentrated first on getting the pages and sections onto my site in the hopes that I would be struck by some sort of inspiration.
    <br>
    <br>
        I used Visual studio code to make my website as it is very flexible and a common tool to use which means that there is a lot of help out there on the internet if you need it. I needed to look up how to do a few elements for my pages that I thought would make the site more interesting.
    <br>
    <br>
        Trello was a useful tool that I used as it helped me keep on top of my tasks. Planning was essential to keep on top of things as you could easily become overwhelmed with the writing, by breaking each individual element down it did not appear so daunting.
    <br>
    <br>
        I plan on using both Trello and Visual Studio Code for future projects as I feel they are excellent tools to use.
</p>
<h2>
        Unit 1 Outcome 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.
</h2>
<p>
        I feel Trello and Visual Studio Code were appropriate for the website task that I was set. They were simple to use and created the outcome that I wanted. I planned the tasks using Trello and executed them in Visual Studio Code.
</p>
<h2>
        Unit 1 Outcome 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project.
</h2>
<p>
        I feel that my final website was a bit boring and plain. I would have loved to have done a bit more with the menu buttons.
<br>
<br>
        Some aspects I am happy with such as readability the text and style are a good size. I am also happy with the text moving over the images on several of my pages.
</p>

<h2>
        Unit 1 Outcome 2.4 describe further improvements you can make to your project.
</h2>
<p>
        Further improvements that could be made are a better menu bar. A few more images to break up the text and maybe header and footers with logo or something added. I would have liked my site to be more dynamic.
</p>

<h2>
        Unit 1 Outcome 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
</h2>
<p>   
My outcomes were fit for purpose because of several reasons. I was able to plan and create a website, planning by using Trello and creating using Visual Studio basic. I made sure that I kept my site consistent by using consistent styles and formatting and I consistently checked my pages for errors to ensure that they were fit for purpose.
