    <h2>
            Unit 1 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency.
    </h2>
<p>
             I feel the task could have run more efficiently if it was done as part of a team project. By using Trello you can break The project down into individual tasks that team members could have each done. This way you can work in a more Agile way, where team members play to their strengths, which helps with decision making and creation of project. The reviewing part could have been done by the team in general to come back with a more comprehensive review on coding, written work etc.
    <br>
    <br>
            A drawback for me was that I am not very experienced using code and I am not a designer. Individual team members could have played to their strengths whilst doing the task, such as some people creating the HTML side of the code and some people working on the design using CSS.

            Data protection Act impacts on how your site handles personal data. If you have an eCommerce business, you will need to be aware of this law. You will need to think how you are tracking customers, storing delivery addresses etc.

<h2>
            Unit 1 Outcome 3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.
</h2>
<p>
            A good solution to improve own productivity was to do the project as part of a team. You can use tools such as Trello and Slack to share ideas and code. Trello will allow you to assign tasks to individuals so no overlapping takes place. Using zoom to hold regular stand ups to keep help keep people motivated in their tasks and to share problems that maybe someone else has a solution to.

<h2>
            Unit 1 Outcome 3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects.
</h2>
<p>
            A way to improve productivity and efficiency for myself would be to ensure that I take regular breaks away from the screen. This is to allow my eyes to rest and freshen me up before I start again. When working from home in future I will ensure that I have a much better and more comfortable home office set up because at present my desk is at work top height and my chair has to be high to accommodate this, which means that my feet are off the floor and I have to have a foot rest.
</p>
<h2>
            Unit 1 Outcome 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
</h2>
<p>
            It is important that you test that all digital solution that you come up with work. I have tested my website by continually running the code to in google to make sure it works, that the pages run and look right. I will also get somebody else to look at and try it.
